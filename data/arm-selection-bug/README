All results present in this directory are affected by a bug in the arm
selection function. The function were testing the last (bad) arm twice,
resulting in a bias towards selecting a bad arm.

Also affected by an off-by-one bug in the round counter. All rounds are off by
one (so 1000 rounds is really 1001 rounds, and so on).
