\section{Summary of Results}

\section{Conclusion}
\emph{“My conclusion offers a compelling final comment to my argument, one that is persuasive for my intended audience.”}

By doing thousands of simulations we have discovered the observation noises that maximise LTS performance in a multitude of settings for the multi armed bandit.
We have also shown how the best observation noise varies with different parameters, thereby providing an improved intuition towards how the observation noise affects performance.

We have also seen that the best observation noise is not trivially decreasing or increasing as we change simulation parameters?

\section{Contributions}
Our contributions consist mainly of an improved empirical and intuitive understanding of how the performance of the LTS strategy can be maximised by choosing correct observation noise.


\section{Further Work}
Much more is yet to be said on this topic.
