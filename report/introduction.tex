This document forms a general structure for a thesis. Normally, background, and
solution chapter may be split into several different chapters!

\section{Introduction}

In this report we investigated what might be are the best observation noise for
different types of bandits and Goore games. By changing the bandits with adding
more arms or changing the values of the arms, then recorded the simulations to
see what difference it made to the simulation. Then check what are the best
possible observation noise are in that case.

\section{Report outline / Thesis Organization}

The rest of this report is structured as follows: In chapter
\ref{ch:background} we present an overview of the background for our research.
Specifically, we define the multi-armed bandit problem, the Goore game, the
technique known as Thompson sampling, (and GP). Subsequently, in chapter
\ref{ch:solution}, we describe the methods we used. The next chapter discusses
our results, and finally we conclude with a summary and suggestions for future
work.
