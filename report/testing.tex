\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

Here we present a representative subset of the obtained results.
We provide graphs to visualise how different parameters influence the results.

Parameter values are likely to interact and impact the end result in different ways, and it may be difficult to capture these interactions directly.
By fixing all but one parameter and testing for a range of values for this parameter, we capture different aspects of how the optimal observation noise changes.

\section{Multiarmed Bandit}
Figure~\ref{fig:ex1} illustrates why, when using LTS, it is important to make a good choice of observation noise.
In this case we see that the total regret achieved increases rapidly when the value is set too low, while it increases slightly as we move past the optimum.
With different setups we see similar results, although the slope after the optimum may be steeper or closer to zero.

LTS is superior to UCB1, when the appropriate observation noise is selected.
In figure~\ref{fig:ex2} this superiority is clearly demonstrated:
Even though UCB1 performs quite good from the start it seems to stop reducing its regret after a while, whereas LTS converges towards zero regret.
The figure also illustrates how a suboptimal choice of \ob{} causes the algorithm to perform worse.

We see generally that as the number of rounds increases, so does the optimal \ob{}.
This is especially apparent in figure~\ref{fig:ex3}, where we have varied the number of arms available to the player.
As the numer of possible actions increases, the optimal \ob{} decreases.
It makes intuitive sense because if there is a large number of arms then we need to be more greedy in our choice of arms, as most of the arms pulled for explorationâ€™s sake will be suboptimal.

\end{figure}
\exsetup{5.0}{0.5}{Varying}{0.5}{5}{fig:ex4}
As the mean of the suboptimal arms get closer to $\mu^*$, more exploration can be afforded due to the small difference in payoffs.
This effect is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:ex4}, where the optimal \ob{} increases along with the mean of the bad arms.

In figure~\ref{fig:ex6} we see that changing the standard deviation of the suboptimal arms does not influence the best choice of observation noise, except for when the number of rounds is very low.
In fact, this seems to hold as long as the standard deviation is kept within reasonable limits.

In contrast, the standard deviation of the best arm has a large influence on \ob{}. As it is increased, \ob{} also increases. (Figure~\ref{fig:ex7}).

\section{Goore Game}

As seen in Figure(Incoming), the higher white noise you have the higher observation noise is needed to achieve
the optimal reward. Also the number of rounds the Goore game is going to be runned(?) also plays into what is
the optimal choice of observation noise. The more rounds it is going to run the higher the observation noise 
is recommended. This increase is not linear but slows down the more rounds you run. 

The ratio of yes and no may also impact the optimal observation noise to some degree.
The more the ratio goes towards 0 or 1, the optimal observation noise rises. However the number of bandits
do not seam to impact the optimal observation noise unless the number of bandits are not optimal for the ratio.
For example having 5 bandits and ratio of 50/50.
