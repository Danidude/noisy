The use of learning automata employing the Thompson sampling method for solving 
the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem is well known, but confusion surrounds 
the all-important parameter for this algoritm -- the observation noise. In this 
paper we investigate how this parameter affects the outcome of bandit 
simulations. We also test this in a Goore game setting where the players are 
modelled as learning automata playing 2-armed bandits.
