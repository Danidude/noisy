\section{Solution for single bandit}

We developed several ways to compute and visualise the needed data. A brute
force method calculating cumulative rewards for all given observation noises, a
method that, given the simulation parameters, employs a bandit approach to
calculating the best observation noise, and a method calculating instant
rewards at log-scale timesteps given the simulation parameters.

\subsection{Brute force solution}

By testing all the values we can examine the results afterwards and determine what
values are the best or what values that need more testing. The downside with this solution
is that you need to run a lot of tests to maybe find the best values for your
parameters.

\subsection{Bandit approach}

As the multi-armed bandit approach can be used to find the maximum of a
stochastic function, it fits perfectly to the task of finding the best
observation noise for a multi-armed bandit employing the local Thompson
sampling strategy.
